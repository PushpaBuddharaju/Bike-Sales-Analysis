# 🚴‍♂️ **Bike Sales Analysis** 🚲  

## 📌 **Overview**  
This project analyzes factors influencing bike purchase decisions using survey data containing 13,351 records. The dataset includes details such as income, age, commute distance, car ownership, and more. The goal was to clean, process, and visualize the data using Excel Pivot Tables and Dashboards to extract meaningful insights about bike buyers and non-buyers.  

## 🛠 **Skills & Tools Used**  
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning** – Removed duplicates, standardized categorical values (e.g., Gender, Marital Status), and created age brackets using Excel formulas.  
- 📊 **Data Analysis** – Used Pivot Tables to analyze key factors affecting bike purchases.  
- 📉 **Data Visualization** – Designed a dynamic dashboard with Pivot Charts and interactive slicers.  
- 📑 **Excel Functions** – Used `IFS`, `Find & Replace`, and Pivot Table aggregations.  

## 🔍 **Key Insights**  
1. **Income vs. Bike Purchase** – Higher-income individuals were more likely to buy bikes, with males having a slightly higher average income than females.

## 🚀 **Recommendations to Boost Bike Sales**  
✅ **Target Middle-Aged Customers** – Since they are the primary bike buyers, marketing campaigns should focus on their interests (e.g., fitness, commuting convenience).  
✅ **Promote Short-Distance Commuting Benefits** – Since most buyers have short commutes, emphasize fuel savings, health benefits, and environmental impact.  
✅ **Offer Trade-In Discounts for Car Owners** – Since bike purchases drop with increased car ownership, offering incentives like trade-in discounts could encourage car owners to buy bikes.  
✅ **Introduce Flexible Payment Plans** – Higher-income individuals tend to buy bikes more often, but offering **installment plans** could make bikes more accessible to lower-income groups.  
✅ **Enhance Community Engagement** – Organizing biking events, group rides, and workshops can encourage more people to adopt cycling as a lifestyle.
